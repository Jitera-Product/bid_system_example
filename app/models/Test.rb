  # Since there are no specific relations mentioned in the "# TABLE" section,

  # Assuming that the 'id', 'created_at', and 'updated_at' fields are automatically
  # managed by Rails, we do not need to add validations for them.

  # Custom methods for the Test model would be defined here if needed.
