class SearchService
  # Existing methods (if any)...

  # Implement a method `parse_query` that takes a string input "query" and uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract key terms and intent.
  def parse_query(query)
    # This is a placeholder for the NLP implementation.
    # In a real-world scenario, you would integrate with an NLP library or service.
    # For the purpose of this example, we'll just split the query into terms.
    query.split(/\W+/)
  end

  # Create a method `search_questions` that takes the parsed terms as input and searches the 'questions' table for matches.
  def search_questions(terms)
    # Assuming the terms are an array of keywords.
    # In a real-world scenario, you might use full-text search capabilities of the database.
    Question.where('content LIKE ?', terms.map { |term| "%#{term}%" })
  end

  # Add a method `select_relevant_questions` that takes the search results as input and selects the most relevant question(s).
  def select_relevant_questions(questions)
    # This is a placeholder for a relevance algorithm.
    # You might sort by the number of matching terms, the date of the question, or other criteria.
    questions.order(created_at: :desc).limit(5)

  # Implement a method `retrieve_answers` that takes the relevant `Question` objects as input and retrieves the corresponding `Answer` objects.
  def retrieve_answers(questions)
    Answer.where(question_id: questions.pluck(:id))
  end

  # If multiple answers are retrieved, add a method `rank_answers` that applies a relevance algorithm to rank the answers.
  def rank_answers(answers)
    # This is a placeholder for an answer ranking algorithm.
    # You might rank based on the length of the answer, the number of upvotes, or other criteria.
    answers.sort_by { |answer| answer.content.length }.reverse
