class UpdateFeedbacksTable < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    # Assuming that the id, created_at, updated_at, comment, usefulness, and content columns are already created
    # and we only need to add new columns or relationships.

    # Add new columns or relationships here as per the new requirements.
    # For example, if we need to add a user_id column as a foreign key to the feedbacks table:
    # add_reference :feedbacks, :user, null: false, foreign_key: true

    # If there are no new columns or relationships to add, then this migration is not needed.
